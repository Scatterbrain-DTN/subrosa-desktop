# Desktop client for Subrosa, a Scatterbrain discussion forum app
Subrosa is a working example of the Scatterbrain desktop api, implementing a compatible version of the [Subrosa](https://github.com/Scatterbrain-DTN/Subrosa) discussion forum app. This app pairs with a phone running [Scatterbrain Router](https://github.com/Scatterbrain-DTN/RoutingServiceFrontend) to exchange offline messages.
